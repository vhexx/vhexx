This application solves 2 classic graph theory problems: Finding a value of a maximal flow in specified transport network and then building a smaller flow(2/3 of maximal) with minimal cost. The transport network(graph) is set by capacity matrix and cost matrix. 
The application has the JavaFX 2.2 GUI.
